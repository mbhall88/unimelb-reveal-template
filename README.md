This repository is designed to be used as a template for people wanting to create a University of Melbourne-themed 
[reveal.js][reveal] slide deck. It is **not** an official University of Melbourne project, but it does adhere to the [typography] 
and [colour palette][palette] guidelines of the university.

## Customise

For customisation topics not addressed below, please first check the [reveal.js documentation][reveal-docs]. If your question is not 
covered there, then [raise an issue](https://github.com/mbhall88/unimelb-reveal-template/issues).

### Colours

The entire [UoM colour palette][palette] is located in the theme SCSS file `css/theme/source/uom.scss`. Use those 
variables to change the colours of any element in the slides by altering the fields in that theme SCSS file, or adding 
any new ones.

### Logo

All slides have a UoM logo in the top left corner. If you want to add additional logos, an example can be found 
in `index.html` - in the commented logos section. You will see an `<img>` tag that has been commented out 
which provides a [Doherty Institute][doherty] logo. If you're at the Doherty Institute, then simply uncomment the 
line. If you want to add a logo for another entity/organisation, you can copy the same process as was used for the 
UoM and Doherty Institute logos.

To change the position of the logos, navigate to the theme SCSS file `css/theme/source/uom.scss` (find the logo 
positioning section). Change the `bottom`, `left` etc. fields to place your logo where you want - or change its size.

### Border

You can change the width and colour of the border(s) in `css/theme/source/uom.scss`. By default, this template only has 
a left border in UoM blue. To add other borders uncomment the relevant `<div>` tags in the border section in `index.html`.
